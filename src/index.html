He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and he is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. <br><br>

Leonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity. He conceptualised flying machines, a type of armoured fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, an adding machine, and the double hull. <br><br>
